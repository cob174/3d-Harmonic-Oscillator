This package contains two python files that demonstrate or
attempt to demonstrate the wavefunctions of the radial function

UvsZ.py demonstrates the wave function with a fixed incrementation of z at energy level n=4 and l=0

UvsR.py attempts to demonstrate the effect on the wave 
function by the value of r,c, and l but is rather inconsistent and inaccurate. It is currently set to n=2, l=1, and c=2 for starting radius r=.01
